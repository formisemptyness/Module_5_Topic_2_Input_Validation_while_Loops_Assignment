# Module_5_Topic_2_Input_Validation_while_Loops_Assignment
 Write a small script, input_while.py that prompts the user for numeric input between 1 and 100. Prompt the user until the input is in the correct range. Once a the input is correct, store the input in a list. Script pseudocode: declare a list variable prompt and get the user input while user input is not good (in range)      prompt user for good input store in list print the list That's not useful! You need multiple inputs from the user,  declare a list variable  declare a sentinel value for user input  prompt get the user input (indicating sentinel value to stop)  while sentinel value is not stopping value        while user input is not good (in range)             prompt user for good input       store in list       prompt and get the next user input  print the list using a for loop     Test running your script in the shell. Add doctring to the top of your file, add comments at the bottom with your tests and observed output after a few test runs of your code. Submit you .py file.
